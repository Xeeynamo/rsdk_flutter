# RSDK Editor

Born as a timeboxed proof of concept to learn Dart and Flutter, this editor aims to offer a complete utility to modify RSDKv3 (Sonic the Hedgehog CD) and RSDKv4 (Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2). It also aims to replace the old [RSDK Animation Editor](https://github.com/xeeynamo/rsdk) I written few years ago.

Using Flutter as a framework allows this editor to run on any major existing platform: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS and even in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge! Flutter is designed to be simple to read and code, while using very good rendering performances without sacrificing good looking animations and language design. To me is the perfect replacement to WPF+C#.
